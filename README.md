- 👋 Hi, I'm Elizabeth, another student in HS. I'm figuring out what I want to do.
- 👀 I'm interested in building a website (and maybe a few games) at promisecoder.github.io (not yet live).
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Python. Next up, Java and C++.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on ... my homework. Got any ~~answers~~ time management help for me? (please, I'm desperate)
- 📫 How to reach me (most to least checked):
  - Email: onceady4@gmail.com
  - Replit: [@onceady](https://replit.com/@onceady)
  - Discord: smrp#9110
- ✔ You may know me as [@PR0M1SE](https://khanacademy.org/profile/PR0M1SE/projects) from KACP. Yay!
